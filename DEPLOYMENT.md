# Xilinx Platform Cable USB deployment

This workflow provides host USB access for Xilinx Platform Cable USB and
Platform Cable USB II devices used by openFPGALoader. It covers vendor ID
`03fd` and product IDs `0013`/`000d` before firmware loading and `0008` after
the cable re-enumerates.

## Build all packages with Docker

From `externals/xilinx-usb-driver`, run `sh ./docker-build.sh`. On Windows
PowerShell, run `.\docker-build.ps1`.

The build creates `dist/xilinx-platform-cable-{linux,windows,macos}.zip` and
SHA-256 files. Docker builds the Linux i686/x86_64 iMPACT compatibility
libraries and the x86/x64 Windows libwdi helper. Host installation is kept out
of containers because containers cannot change Windows/macOS host drivers or
Linux host udev policy.

## Linux

Extract the Linux ZIP and run `sudo ./install.sh`. Reconnect the cable, then:

```sh
openFPGALoader --cable xilinxPlatformCableUsb --detect
```

The libraries under `lib/` are only for legacy Xilinx ISE/iMPACT. Select the
directory matching the ISE process architecture and preload it, for example:

```sh
LD_PRELOAD="$PWD/lib/x86_64/libusb-driver.so" impact
```

Firmware (`xusb_xp2.hex` or `xusb_emb.hex`) remains Xilinx software and is not
redistributed. Give openFPGALoader the file with `--probe-firmware`, set
`OPENFPGALOADER_XUSB_FIRMWARE`, or use firmware installed with ISE/Vivado.

## Windows

Extract the Windows ZIP, open PowerShell as Administrator, and run:

```powershell
.\install.ps1
.\detect.ps1
```

The installer binds WinUSB to all three XPCU identities using the Docker-built
libwdi helper. This intentionally replaces the vendor driver for these device
IDs. Reinstall the AMD/Xilinx cable driver from Vivado if vendor applications
later require it.

The Windows build uses the reliable USB control-transfer JTAG path by default.
The accelerated `0xA6` path can be tested explicitly by setting
`OPENFPGALOADER_XPCU_ACCELERATED=1`; some XPCU firmware/WinUSB combinations
stall endpoint zero when that command is used.

For bootloader, driver-binding, firmware-reload, and JTAG-chain symptoms, see
[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md). The complete hardware debug record is
in [`docs/xilinx-platform-cable-usb-windows-debug.md`](../../docs/xilinx-platform-cable-usb-windows-debug.md).

## macOS

Extract the macOS ZIP and run `./install.sh`. macOS needs libusb and a
libusb-enabled openFPGALoader build; it does not use a separately installed
XPCU kernel driver. The helper detects the cable and installs Homebrew libusb
when Homebrew is available.

## Container USB limitation

The produced files are intended for native host use. Linux can pass the cable
to a container with an explicit `/dev/bus/usb` mapping, but the cable
disconnects and re-enumerates while firmware loads, so mapping the entire USB
bus is usually required. Docker Desktop on Windows and macOS does not provide
equivalent transparent USB passthrough; run openFPGALoader on those hosts.
